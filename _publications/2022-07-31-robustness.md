title: "On the robustness of the metric dimension of grid graphs to adding a single edge"
collection: publications
link: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dam.2022.02.014
excerpt: 'We prove that if we add an extra edge to a (large enough) d-dimensional grid graph, then the resulting graph will have metric dimension between d and 2d, and we almost completely settle the case for d=2.'
