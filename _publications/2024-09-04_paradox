title: "Epidemic paradox induced by awareness driven network dynamics"
collection: publications
link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01384
excerpt: 'We study stationary epidemic processes in scale-free networks with local awareness behavior adopted by only infected or all nodes, and paradoxically, we find and prove that the former scenario results in a smaller infection while more nodes can be aware in the latter.'
