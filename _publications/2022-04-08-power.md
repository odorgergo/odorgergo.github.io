title: "The power of adaptivity in source identification with time queries on the path"
collection: publications
link: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2022.02.008
excerpt: 'We provide the first theoretical results on the query complexity of the source identification problem when queried nodes report their infection time; in the adaptive case we need only Θ(loglog(n)) queries, while in the non-adaptive case Θ(n) queries are needed.'
