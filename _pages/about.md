I am broadly interested in network science and computational epidemiology, with a special focus on wasterwater-based epidemiology. As of September 2024, I am a FWF Cluster of Excellence: ["Microbiomes Drive Planetary Health”](https://microplanet.at/) postdoc at the [Bergthaler Lab](https://bergthalerlab.org/), Medical University of Vienna.

**SNSF Postdoc Mobility Fellow (2022-2024)**


Previously, I worked on [Awareness Modelling in Epidemics](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/211129) as an SNSF Postdoc Mobility Fellow hosted by [Márton Karsai](https://www.martonkarsai.com/) at DNDS, CEU, Vienna. Recent manuscripts on this topic include a genetic data-driven [\[1\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59508-5) and a network theoretic [\[2\]](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.7.L012061) approach.


**PhD (2017-2022)**


My thesis was on the source idenitfication problem; the goal is to design efficient algorithms that find the first infected individual (also called patient zero) during an epidemic, based on sparse measurements about who got infected and when. I was fortunate to be advised by [Patrick Thiran](https://people.epfl.ch/patrick.thiran?lang=en) at EPFL.

On the algorithmic side, I have worked on rigorously quantifying the role of adaptivity in source identification: the difference between the problem settings when the measurements are chosen adaptively vs non-adaptively. If the epidemic spreads very aggressively, the theoretical analysis ([\[3\]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejc.2021.103317) and [\[4\]](https://doi.org/10.1017/jpr.2021.16)) becomes equivalent to adaptive and non-adaptive versions of the metric dimension from the combinatorics literature. If the epidemic is less aggressive, then there is more stochasticity in the problem, making the analysis more challenging [\[5\]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2022.02.008). Interestingly, in some cases adaptivity only plays a small role [\[3\]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejc.2021.103317), whereas in others, its role is very substantial [\[5\]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2022.02.008).

More on the modelling (but still rigorous) side, I have worked on relaxing the assumption in the source identification problem that the underlying contact network is fully known to the algorithm [\[6\]](https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs41109-023-00566-3). Also in this direction, we studied the robustness of the metric dimension to single edge changes [\[7\]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dam.2022.02.014). 

Slightly deviating from the algorithmic source identification problem, I have worked on understanding how the location of (multiple) seeds affect the outcome of an epidemic (modelling [\[8\]](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2112607118) and theory [\[9\]](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jgt.23184)).
