2021-10-14	Switchover phenomenon induced by epidemic seeding on geometric networks	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences	We observe empirically and prove theoretically a new phenomenon related to how the initial seeding affects the outcome of an epidemic.

2022-04-08	The power of adaptivity in source identification with time queries on the path	Theoretical Computer Science	"We provide the first theoretical results on the query complexity of the source identification problem when queried nodes report their infection time; in the adaptive case we need only _(loglog(n)) queries, while in the non-adaptive case _(n) queries are needed."

2021-11-21	Sequential metric dimension for random graphs	Journal of Applied Probability	We prove that the sequential version of the metric dimension (where the landmarks can be chosen adaptively to distinguish every pair of nodes based on distances) is only a multiplicative constant factor smaller than the (non-adaptive) metric dimension in Erdos-Renyi graphs	Gergely îdor and Patrick Thiran	smd	https://doi.org/10.1017/jpr.2021.16	png
2021-06-01	Metric dimension of critical Galton-Watson trees and linear preferential attachment trees	European Journal of Combinatorics	"Building on the literature of fringe trees, we prove law of large numbers type results for the metric dimension of various random trees."	"Jœlia Komj‡thy, Gergely îdor"	fringe	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejc.2021.103317	png
2021-12-29	Source Detection via Contact Tracing in the Presence of Asymptomatic Patients	arxiv	"We define and prove rigorous results about a new source identification framework, where the network is initially not known to the algorithm, but must be explored through queries (similarly to the node infection times), and we evaluate our algorithms on realistic datasets."

2022-07-31	On the robustness of the metric dimension of grid graphs to adding a single edge	Discrete Applied Mathematics	"We prove that if we add an extra edge to a (large enough) d-dimensional grid graph, then the resulting graph will have metric dimension between d and 2d, and we almost completely settle the case for d=2."
